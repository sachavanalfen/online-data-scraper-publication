          <h2>Cancer</h2>
          <h3>/ˈkansə/ - noun</h3>
          <P>This is usually in reference to Aggro Decks like Hunter and Zoo Warlock that use low cost minions and direct damage to burn down the opponent. This can also refer to decks that are frequently encountered on the ladder which are a “cancer” on the meta.</P>

          <h2>Cantrip</h2>
          <h3>/ˈkantrɪp/ - noun</h3>
          <P>Another term from MTG that refers to cards that have a “draw a card” effect along with their main effect. The perfect example of this in Hearthstone is Flare. This term is sometimes used as a catch-all for cards that allow you to draw a card.</P>

          <h2>Casual</h2>
          <h3>/ˈkaʒjʊəl/ - noun</h3>
          <P>Play against eachother without ranking.</P>

          <h2>Charge</h2>
          <h3>/tʃɑːdʒ/ - verb</h3>
          <P>Can attack immediately.</P>

          <h2>Classic</h2>
          <h3>/ˈklasɪk/ - verb</h3>
          <P>Classic (formerly known as Expert) is the largest card set in Hearthstone, with 245 collectible cards. The Classic set serves as one of the two core card sets in Hearthstone, the other being the Basic set. </P>

          <h2>Combo</h2>
          <h3>/ˈkɒmbəʊ/ - noun</h3>
          <P>Decks referred to as combo decks seek to initiate powerful interactions with multiple cards that inevitably lead to victory. A common combo finisher in Rogue decks is Leeroy Jenkins and 1x – 2x Cold Blood.</P>

          <h2>Constructed</h2>
          <h3>/kənˈstrʌkt/ - verb</h3>
          <P>This term refers to the ability to build a deck from cards you own for use in Ranked or Casual play. Arena is what would be referred to as a Limited format, because you are limited to the amount of cards you play from.</P>

          <h2>Control</h2>
          <h3>/kənˈtrəʊl/ - noun</h3>
          <P>A deck is labeled Control if it seeks to hold the board by using defensive minions (taunts) and utilizing AOE and Spell cards to destroy minions. It then finishes off the opponent with late game minions and threats.</P>

          <h2>Counter</h2>
          <h3>/ˈkaʊntə/ - noun</h3>
          <P>A card that is Countered has no effect. Currently the only card that has this keyword is Counterspell.</P>

          <h2>CubeLock</h2>

          <P>Cube Warlock (sometimes referred to as "Cubelock") is a combo focused Warlock control deck type.</P>

          <h2>Cycle</h2>
          <h3>/ˈsʌɪk(ə)l/ - verb</h3>
