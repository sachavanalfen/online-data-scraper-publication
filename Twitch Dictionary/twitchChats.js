T9, which you saw in the screenshot, was resummonnings two 1/1s, double Talonpriest, and Divine Spirit.  You could argue that Brann Kazakus and ignore the board would have been better, because of the polymorph potential, but not having Ice Block up, I didn't want to let him have a board.

I was lucky enough because I don't think I'd been able to win that game under normal circumstances.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nI was playing fatigue warrior against some kind of midrange priest, and he curved out nicely while I didn't draw any weapons. I eventually somewhat stabilize but then he drops the sneeds he got from his museum curator. (I know this is sounding like the salt thread, let me get to the good part!) I'm then like, screw it, and cruel task executed it. I am greeted by none other than majordomo executus! I immediately introduce him to my bgh, and next turn I show his buddy ragnaros my bash and gorehowl. :D\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nI once played against a Paladin with no Cancerous Challenger in his deck. I won.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nI just had an incredible game against a golden warlock in casual.\nHe seems to be trying out a discard warlock of some kind. I'm playing my beast Druid. the game is REALLY back and forth, and i finally get control. \nHe drops a Voidcaller when he is at 5 health, and then casts Demonheart on it. My board is a Mounted Raptor, a 4/1 Tomb Spider, and a 4/1 Wildwalker and i have 3 health and 1 armour. so i can break the 8 health voidcaller no problem and win. He taps down to 3 and i immediately think \"he's just lost the game for himself\"\nHe topdecks a Soulfire from his tap and wins.\nIt was so close i started clapping.\nI wish i added him after the game to thank him.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nGot down a handlock with raptor rogue after surviving both molten giants, both healbots both shadowflames, a twilight drake and both belchers. Reaaally deserved win, despite I was really lucky to be able to keep pressure.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nOh, man. I had a pretty hearth-pumping game last night. I can be so fucking dumb sometimes...\nSo I was playing against Hunter with Warlock at rank 5. We both had something like 10 hp left. I had Mal'Ganis on empty board. He played Savannah Highmane. I had Power Overwhelming and Defender of Argus in hand. I guess I was focusing on music or something didn't think too much. Thought to myself that's certainly lethal and continued to buff my Mal'Ganis and attack. Then sudden realization it was one of lethal, but not with Defender of Argus which I didn't play. I was hitting my head to the table pretty hard. I was certain that I was dead the next turn.\nI held back tears and continued to tap. Got Knife Juggler out of my deck. I still had a chance. It all came down to 50/50 me losing or winning. Took a brief moment to pray for RNGesus to give me power to win. Then few clicks and BOOM. Knife Juggler hits to the face and I was declared a winner. Tears where rolling on my cheeks  and my hearth was beating like freaking alarm clock. What a game. Sometimes dumb and sometimes lucky. \n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nThere's just nothing better than beating an opponent even after they Reno. Caught a Renolock this morning who Farseer'ed and Reno'd, and one yesterday who got Healbot, Refreshment Vendor, and Reno during the course of the game.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nJust drafted a Paladin arena deck, picked 5 secrets and got a Mysterious Challenger on the last card.  Top decked it in my first game on turn 6.  I can't imagine the salt of the other player.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nEntomb Priest mirror in casual (I'm trying to learn the deck) becomes the Battle of Rhonin:\nHe gets a (golden) Rhonin from a (golden) Confessor. It looks nice.\nI kill everything else and entomb the Rhonin. I draw a little extra even though this means I'll be first in fatigue. Find the Rhonin. Play it. Opponent entombs it.\nI'm ahead on board but also going into fatigue. Then he plays Rhonin in an effort to get caught up on board. I entomb it.\nFortunately, either he didn't draw his second or was only playing one, so I was able to cast Rhonin and then kill him with it next turn. I could have Lightbombed and then killed him with the missiles instead, but that would have been rude.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nI like playing rogue. And it's great against palladins, which infest the meta. So I can get to rank five pretty easily. The problem is tempo/mech mages. Rogues don't have many minions in their deck. So the ones there are all pretty valuable. Like shredders. Mirror images plus lots of removal make mages a pain. But just now I tried out a cycle oil rogue. Just beat 3 out of four tempo mages and fiveish palladins sfrom rank six to four. I may have found THE deck for this meta. I've gotten legend with oil rogue b4, maybe again this season.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nTrying out Reno/Elise Fatigue Warrior in ladder, as fate would have it 3rd match is versus a fatigue Reno Mage. I have a huge amount of armor and full health even after his Alekstrasza. We're down to our last few cards, I pull Golden Monkey with around 5 cards left. I also got gang up from Sarad and used it on his Ethreal Conjurer to try to fill my hand with spells for when golden monkey comes (because let's face it, warrior spells are kind of crap in a vaccum).\nAnyways, long story short, he is in fatigue with Ice Block up, he's knocked my armor down and has next turn lethal on me because of a Molten Giant that I had no answer to for 3 turns. He has 13 HP and I have a 4/2 Gorehowl up (I used upgrade on it 2 times from those Ethreal Conjurers I ganged up and had already swung at him once) I draw my last card which is King Crush LOL. I swing weapon for 4, and charge for 8, fatigue kills him next turn bypassing Ice block.\nNever lucky except in this match ;)\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\nI just faced a shaman whose turn one was Tunnel Trogg + Coin + Leper Gnome. I was playing RenoLock, and mr. Jackson kindly healed me for 28 on turn 8. My opponent conceded. :D\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","",""]
