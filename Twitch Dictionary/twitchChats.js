Or are you not? 100 percent of my games end the same way. I’m sacked. Or my opp has the nuts. Outplays do not exist. If blizzard doesn’t change their card design by next set I’m fucking done. Cuz I’m sick of being in a winning position but oh what’s that? My opp topped exactly what he needed? Or topped then discovered exactly what he needed? Damn that’s just such a fun game to play! Love how my play has basically 0 effect on the outcome. Oh and the constant bming in addition of people who add me to taunt me and act like disgusting freaks doesn’t help things either. Pretty fucking sick of it. The fact you can’t report someone who isn’t on your friends list is absolute garbage.

// ["\n\n\n\n\nSo how was my experience in wild ladder today? Wasn't the usual soul crushing losses but losses to a bunch of really bad players including an aggro shaman with 2 Ancestral Spirit in his deck. Apparently none of the other powerful 1-2 drops in the game hold a candle to one of the most dead cards that doesn't synergize with the deck at all. I wish I could see what this guy's thought process was like adding that card into aggro shaman-if there was any at all.\nOh how I just love losing to bad players that don't deserve the win just because the RNG gods like to fuck with me.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n\n\n\n Also, can't stand the players that feel the need to hover over every thing constantly, play with their hand and hover over every card I play like some ADHD child. \nIf you are that kind of person and are reading this you need to seriously calm the fuck down. Also if you keep hovering over the same card in your hand you are giving me information on what it could be.

To be frank you kinda deserved that if you emote like a madman. The pally probably knew he was gonna lose and noticed you getting triggered so he ropes to get you more riled up and lose focus and possibly make a mistake off that...and it worked. fucking with players composure is a viable tactic in any game with a competitive format and I'm surprised most pros haven't realized yet.\n\n\n\n","","","","","","","","","","","","","\n\n \n\n\nI feel your pain, bro.
