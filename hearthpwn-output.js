So how was my experience in wild ladder today? Wasn't the usual soul crushing losses but losses to a bunch of really bad players including an aggro shaman with 2 Ancestral Spirit in his deck. Apparently none of the other powerful 1-2 drops in the game hold a candle to one of the most dead cards that doesn't synergize with the deck at all. I wish I could see what this guy's thought process was like adding that card into aggro shaman-if there was any at all.
Oh how I just love losing to bad players that don't deserve the win just because the RNG gods like to fuck with me.

 Also, can't stand the players that feel the need to hover over every thing constantly, play with their hand and hover over every card I play like some ADHD child. 
If you are that kind of person and are reading this you need to seriously calm the fuck down. Also if you keep hovering over the same card in your hand you are giving me information on what it could be. So do us both a favour and please stop.

 I'm cool with Cube Warlock swarming the ladder. It's a tier-one deck, it happens.However, I think it's fucking bullshit that Cube has also infested Casual, where people choose to go after playing ladder to actually have fun with creative decks without running into the same net decks over and over. The fun is still there, as I don't lose anything if I lose games, but it's incredibly infuriating to play against 5 Cubelocks out of roughly every 10 games on ladder, then to have the same problem in casual.TAKE YOUR T1 DECKS TO RANKED, SCRUBS.

I was playing a big spell control mage deck that I made against a Paladin. The guy was roping every single turn but I had all the right plays and counters. We get down towards the end and I have him with 0 cards in hand and a secret. I played Alex on myself as well as the death knight to give me 5 more health and healing. I start emoting him because his roping the whole game pissed me off. I attack with my 8/8 Alex and it was eye for an eye. I was still in a good position with a few water ele's on board as well as Alex and an ice block. I keep thanking him and saying hello as I clear his board and stretch out the game. I didn't even notice that he somehow played another secret. Instead of pinging, I attack his face with Alex. Eye for an eye again and it goes right through my ice block and kills me. I can't tell you how much that pissed me off.

 Agreed, I wonder how those kinds of people sleep at night or look at themselves in the mirror. You can't be so inconsiderate and loathing of the Ladder to resort to something like that..have some fucking decency It's like somebody invited the biggest asshole to a party

 Cockiness is an insidious killer. To be frank you kinda deserved that if you emote like a madman. The pally probably knew he was gonna lose and noticed you getting triggered so he ropes to get you more riled up and lose focus and possibly make a mistake off that...and it worked. fucking with players composure is a viable tactic in any game with a competitive format and I'm surprised most pros haven't realized yet.

I feel your pain, bro. I'm playing big spell mage as well and know how hard it is to win consistently with this deck (especially with so many murlocadins and secret infidels). But as for your story, you simply misplayed, happens to everyone. Paladins often choose eye for an eye over other secrets specifically to counter our ice block. The good side is that next time you will sure avoid this mistake.

I can't remember the last time I won a game.



,,,,,,,,,,,,,




Wow all those ex-raza priests now bandwagoning cubelock , you guys are so great and force people to play cancer mage, fucking scum



,,,,,,,,,,,,




with these resetting threads how will people know how truly shit hearthstone is



,,,,,,,,,,




Why are people playing cubelock and secret mage in CASUAL? That's the place I go to get far away from that bs.. Their decks don't even have any innovation and are copied card by card from the top lists.
When do we get a real casual mode with no rewards? I really want to play meme jank but getting matched vs top tier meta decks is seriously tilting.
Edited out unecessary profanities.



,,,,,,,,,,,,,,




Let's make turns 1 and 2 quicker! Stops ropers, great idea!Until Hearthstone decides to fucking freeze up and you miss turns 1 AND 2 against an aggro deck.



,,,,,,,,,,,,




Hearthstone!
1% fun.
99% mind numbing pain. 
100% self hate for letting Blizzard tease you with a good time. 
IN THE END YOU WILL GET WAY MORE SATISFACTION PUTTING QUARTERS IN AN EMPTY GUM BALL MACHINE THAN YOU EVER WILL PLAYING A BLIZZARD GAME.

 It's a matter of mutual respect. It more than likely began with a few select assholes that have compensatory power/control issues and need to dominate people some way or another even if it's for no gain. A lot of people probably didn't start playing Cube in casual until they started facing it over and over, then just said fuck it just to end their own misery. I'm just not sure why this happened all of the sudden. It's not like I had a problem running into Raza Priest or Tempo Rogue in casual pre-nerf... It's whatever though. I don't have a problem playing ranked all of the time.

Why is it that when I'm playing arena, the worse my opponent plays, the better his luck is?

You might as well uninstall right now, HS attracts OCD gambling addicts.
Blizzard wont improve the game when they make millions off invalids who would gladly play the same 30 cards 24/7 for 100 years.

uright. It's like I said, though. I'm cool w playing ranked all of the time. xD

I think you meant invalids who would gladly pay 100$ for 30% of an expansion, every expansion. Now that's a disability.

I'm so salty with the current meta! The nerfs made decks which were strong pre-nerf even stronger. Yes, I'm talking about murloc paladin and secret mage. I went from rank 6 **** to 8 (zero stars) by playing only against these two decks (not exaggerating) until I finally encountered another control mage and won. I even miss cubelocks because for my deck (control mage) they are kinda favorable matchup. 
Raza and Patches were cancer, yes, but so many decks are now gone because of the nerf and the current "meta" looks just dumb and kinda narrow.
